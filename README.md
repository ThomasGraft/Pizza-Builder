# Pizza-Builder

This is a project I build for my CSC420: IT Project Management class

A simple WebForms app with multiple forms and several different types of controls. It allows you to build pizzas, add and remove pizzas to an order, and then check the order out.

I chose to build this project while learning how to manage IT projects using Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban.
